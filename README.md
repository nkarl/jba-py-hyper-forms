## [JBA-Py] Project: Hyper Forms

In this project, I attempt to move up from the previous small simple coding (CLI) project and learn to construct an end-user product (a website).  I will learn how to do this using Django.


### Project Description
Let's create our own Google Forms!  In this project, you'll create a webpage with forms that can be filled by your visitors.  Add as many forms as you like and update them on the fly.


### Learning Outcomes
Set up a simple Django project.  Handle requests and make/render templates for your own web pages.  You will also learn how to save and retrieve data from a database.
